\begin{abstract}
Is ``cow'' more closely related to ``grass'' or ``chicken''? Speakers of
different languages judge similarity in this context differently, but
why? One possibility is that cultures co-varying with these languages
induce differences in conceptualizations of similarity. Specifically,
East Asian cultures may promote reasoning about thematic similarity, by
which cow and grass are more related, whereas Western cultures may bias
judgements toward taxonomic relations, like cow-chicken. This difference
in notions of similarity is the consensus interpretation for
cross-cultural variation in this paradigm. We consider, and provide
evidence for, an alternative possibility, by which notions of similarity
are similar across contexts, but the statistics of the environment vary.
On this account, similarity judgements are guided by co-occurrence in
experience, and observing or hearing about cows and grass or cows and
chickens more often could induce preferences for these groupings, and
account in part for apparent differences in notions of similarity across
contexts.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

By virtue of discrete words and grammatical features, language provides
a categorical partition of our continuous experiences. By measuring the
similarity between words (as commonly done with lexical co-occurrence
models), it may be possible to model the shape of similarity space in
order to capture cross-linguistic and cross-cultural variation and
provide a more general answer to the question of how language influences
our conception of the world.

Taxonomic and thematic similarity provide a convenient entry point to
broader debates about cross-linguistic and cross-cultural variation in
notions of similarity. Taxonomic categorization is based on the
similarity of attributes, for example, similar perceptual properties,
like shared color or shape, among objects. In contrast, thematic
categorization is based on causal, spatial, and temporal relationships
among objects (Markman \& Hutchinson, 1984).

\hypertarget{cross-cultural-variation-in-similarity}{%
\subsection{Cross-cultural variation in
similarity}\label{cross-cultural-variation-in-similarity}}

Preferences for taxonomic and thematic similarity vary across cultures.
Chiu (1972) found that Chinese children (9-10 years old) are more likely
to choose thematic matches in a picture triad task (shown, e.g., images
of an ant, a bee, and honey) than their American counterparts. These
cross-cultural differences are also observed in novel object
categorization, with Chinese participants preferring to group by family
resemblance across multiple features and Americans preferring a
single-feature rule (Norenzayan, Smith, Kim, \& Nisbett, 2002). The
authors link these differences to tendencies toward analytic processing
in Western cultures, which emphasizes objects and their properties, and
holistic processing in East Asian cultures, which emphasizes
relationships between objects and their context (see also Nisbett
(2003)). In related work, East Asian participants show a higher level of
sensitivity to context than their Western counterparts when reproducing
drawings from memory (Ji, Peng, \& Nisbett, 2000); visually exploring
naturalistic scenes (Chua, Boland, \& Nisbett, 2005); describing scenes
(Masuda \& Nisbett, 2001); and in explaining the causes of ambiguous
behaviors (Choi, Nisbett, \& Norenzayan, 1999).

Ji, Zhang, \& Nisbett (2004) asked whether differences in analytic and
holistic processing are driven by language, culture, or a combination of
these. They presented Chinese and European American adults with a word
triad task, and found a preference for thematic matching among Chinese
participants compared to European Americans. They found that test
language contributed to this difference, but did not fully explain it:
Chinese participants showed a stronger thematic preference when tested
in Mandarin, but still showed a thematic preference when tested in
English. Ji et al.~conclude that culture (independent of language) leads
to different styles of reasoning about similarity, whereas language
serves as a ``tuning'' mechanism operating within a culturally-specific
style, by activating representations corresponding to the language being
used.\footnote{But note that this work did not include a manipulation to
  prevent participants from engaging in e.g., covert naming in a
  language other than the test language.}

This view ascribes cross-cultural differences in similarity judgment to
variation in the conceptualization of similarity itself. Alternatively,
these judgments could be shaped by cross-cultural differences in the
statistics of the environment, and accordingly the content of everyday
experiences. Perhaps when confronted with the triad task, participants
from all cultures follow the same process for reasoning about
similarity, but rely on language or culture-specific inputs to this
process. If we observe a difference in categorization between East Asian
and Western participants, it could be that members of both groups use
the same procedure (considering similarity that is influenced by both
taxonomic and thematic relations), but the inputs to this procedure
differ between cultures, with East Asian participants exposed to more
instances of thematic similarity than their Western counterparts.

\hypertarget{estimating-variation-in-experience}{%
\subsection{Estimating variation in
experience}\label{estimating-variation-in-experience}}

While co-occurrences in experience are difficult to measure,
co-occurrence in language can provide a rough proxy--and indeed,
language may afford many of the ``experiences'' that people have with
infrequently encountered items, like cows or helicopters. In this study,
we use co-occurrence in language as a proxy of cultural experience. This
is a generalizing assumption, and while no linguistic corpus can be
expected to fully capture a culture, using this proxy as a model of
culture provides a conservative test of the hypothesis that differences
in the input, rather than the process, of reasoning produces cultural
variation in this task. This means that if such a model does work -- if
linguistic co-occurrence can predict cultural variation in this
similarity task without building differences in the decision process
into the model -- it is relatively strong evidence that language alone
(perhaps as a more easily observed source of information on broader
cultural and ecological variation) may account for these cross-cultural
differences in reasoning.

Indeed, previous work suggests that using lexical co-occurrence as a
proxy can be useful in thinking about similarity reasoning. Natural
language processing tasks have found that lexical co-occurrence is a
good predictor for performance in similarity judgment. Griffiths,
Steyvers, \& Tenenbaum (2007) showed that a model that takes
word-document co-occurrence as input can be used to predict word
association and the effects of semantic association on a variety of
linguistic tasks. Additionally, lexical semantic models that are
constructed using lexical co-occurrence (as opposed to annotated
relations) have been shown to perform well on predicting human judgments
about similarity between word pairs that are thematically or
taxonomically related (Rohde, Gonnerman, \& Plaut, 2006).

Our study uses cosine distances of fastText word vectors as a measure of
lexical co-occurrence\footnote{We also carried out our analysis using
  raw lexical co-occurrences and obtained similar results.}. fastText is
a system that uses lexical co-occurrence information to generate a
vector representing each word in its lexicon (Mikolov, Grave,
Bojanowski, Puhrsch, \& Joulin, 2018).

Systems like fastText and word2vec have been demonstrated to be good
predictors for similarity judgments. Liu, Feng, Wu, Chan, \& Fulton
(2019) showed that fastText performed well as the data for a system
matching responses in a knowledge base by how similar they are to a
customer's query. A study by Jatnika, Bijaksana, \& Suryani (2019)
tested a word2vec model trained on the English wikipedia corpus against
353 word pairs labeled with similarity values based on human judgment.
The word2vec model correlates moderately with human judgment. fastText
has also been shown to be sensitive towards cultural effects on word
meanings: Thompson \& Lupyan (2020) applied fastText to
language-specific Wikipedia corpus (among others) to generate a
``semantic neighborhood'' of 1010 meanings in different languages. The
study showed that languages that are spoken by more similar cultures,
more geographically proximate and/or historically related had more
semantic neighborhoods that aligned. This is a proof of concept for our
use of fastText in different languages with varying levels of
relatedness.

\hypertarget{the-present-study}{%
\subsection{The present study}\label{the-present-study}}

Ji et al. (2004) suggest that the notion of similarity is what varies
across cultural groups, but it is possible that similarity is regarded
in the same way and it is actually the input to this similarity judgment
that varies across cultural contexts. It may be possible to gain
traction on potential mechanisms by examining whether variation in
similarity judgments co-vary with environmental statistics that differ
across cultural and linguistic contexts.

In this study, we ask whether variation in lexical co-occurrence can
account for the cross-context (culture and language) differences
observed in how people evaluate similarity. First, we attempt to
replicate Ji et al. (2004) by running a study comparing English speakers
in the US and Mandarin speakers in mainland China. Second, we evaluate
whether the differences observed between English and Mandarin speakers'
similarity judgments also extend to comparisons between English and
Vietnamese, by running a similar study between English speakers in the
US and Vietnamese speakers in Vietnam. Vietnam is a Southeast Asian
country that borders China and is historically greatly influenced by
Chinese culture (Hui, 2002). Therefore, it serves as a suitable cultural
context to investigate whether the claim made by Ji et al. (2004) and
previous studies, that Eastern and Western cultures have different
notions of similarity, extends beyond mainland China.

We then ask to what extent similarity judgments show cross-context
differences that align with co-occurrence patterns in participants'
languages. We would only see a main effect of cultural context if
differing notions of similarity drive these cross-cultural differences.
Meanwhile, if we do see variation in responding trial-to-trial that
tracks with lexical co-occurrence statistics (as a rough proxy combining
both linguistic and cultural context), this suggests that cross-cultural
notions of similarity might be similar, and it is environmental
statistics that guide the differences in similarity judgments.

To preview our results, we find that, while we do not see overall group
differences (between the East Asian contexts and the US) in similarity,
we do find language-specific co-occurrence can indeed explain
cross-context differences in similarity judgments. In contrast to
previous accounts, by which culture induces differing conceptions of
similarity (varying between taxonomic and thematic), these findings
provide an alternative, and more specific, account by which language may
explain these cross-cultural differences without invoking variation in
notions of similarity.

There are several important limitations of our approach. While we
discuss cross-cultural variability at the level of countries or larger
world areas, these are not cultural monoliths. For convenience, we
operationalize culture at the level of country, based on where
participants were raised. It is an open question whether performance in
our participant populations (of relatively young and well-educated
adults) is representative of the broader country. This is especially
true for societies with substantial ethnic and cultural variation such
as the US. We expect that our data is likely to underestimate variation
both within and between the countries we sample from.

Language, culture, cognition, and individual experiences are intertwined
in complex causal relationships: cultural features (farming) can lead to
differences in individuals' experiences (seeing cows and grass) and in
turn these can influence language (talking more about cows and grass).
But cultural features (a thematic orientation) could also more directly
cause individuals to talk differently about the same experiences
(mentioning what cows eat rather than what other animals cows are like).
In this study, we measure language and its relation to cross-cultural
differences in categorization, but these relations test only the
plausibility of a language-based account; they cannot establish the
direction of causality.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

We recruited 200 participants from the US, 199 participants from
Vietnam, and 200 participants from mainland China. US participants were
recruited through snowball sampling seeded with Stanford student email
lists, Vietnam participants were recruited through snowball sampling
seeded with Vietnam-based student groups on Facebook, and mainland China
participants were recruited through snowball sampling seeded with group
chats on WeChat. US participants were compensated with \$5 gift
certificates (USD), VN participants received 50,000₫ (VND) in phone
credit, and mainland China participants received 25CNY through WeChat
credit transfer.

We excluded 26 US participants, 123 Vietnam participants, and 34 China
participants who did not answer all attention checks correctly. We
followed 4 exclusion criteria that aim to retain only participants who
are influenced by one culture: (1) non-native speakers of English and
Vietnamese, respectively, (2) fluent in at least one of the other two
study languages (Vietnamese for US participants, English for Vietnamese
participants and Chinese participants), (3) have lived outside of the
test country (US, Vietnam, or China) for more than two years, and (4)
have significant international experience (more than 6 international
experiences of 2 days or longer.) We did not use a particular criterion
for a language if it would exclude 25\% or more of any one sample. In
this round of exclusion, we excluded 65 US, 19 Vietnam participants, and
34 China participants. After these exclusions, the US sample included
109 participants (27M, 78F, 3 non-binary, 1 other), with mean age = 22.4
(SD = 8.49) and median age = 20. The Vietnam sample included 57
participants (17M, 40F, other), with mean age = 22.21 (SD = 6.12) and
median age = 21. The China sample included 132 participants (51M, 81F,
other), with mean age = 23.27 (SD = 3.75) and median age =
23.\footnote{A table summarizing number of participants lost at each
  round of exclusions is included in the Appendix.}

Notably, we lost a majority of our Vietnam participants (more than 60\%)
in the attention check exclusion. One reason we suspect why this might
have happened is because our Vietnam participants are less familiar with
research surveys and attention check questions, and thus might have
thought too much about the attention check questions.\footnote{We
  carried out an exploratory analysis where we used a less stringent
  attention check exclusion (covered in the final part of the Results \&
  Analysis section). To preview our findings for this analysis, we did
  not find any difference in significant results when compared with the
  main analysis.}

\hypertarget{stimuli}{%
\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}}

We adapted stimuli from previous studies to create a set of test triads
consisting of a cue, with one thematic and one taxonomic match option.
For example, ``cow,'' ``grass,'' and ``chicken,'' where ``cow'' is the
cue, ``grass'' is the thematic match, and ``chicken'' the taxonomic
match. We included 105 such triads, a superset including triads pulled
from supplemental information and in-text examples across the
literature, and others that we adapted or created . We selected triads
on the basis of cultural familiarity in the US, Vietnam, and China. The
triads were originally in English; they were translated to Vietnamese
and Mandarin by a fluent bilingual speaker in each language. The
translations were then checked for accuracy after backtranslation to
English by another fluent bilingual in each language who was naive to
the original English versions. --\textgreater{}

Each participant completed all 105 triads in sets of 21 trials at a time
(10 test triads, 10 filler triads, and 1 attention check per page), by
selecting the match most related to the cue (``Which thing is most
closely related to the bolded item?'' or ``Thứ nào liên quan nhất với
thứ được in đậm?''). The test triads were presented with 105 filler
triads mixed in, to obscure the taxonomic-thematic two-answer forced
choice structure of the test stimuli and reduce the likelihood that
participants would become aware of the design. The filler triads were
groups of three semantically related words, but where the match options
were not distinguished by thematic vs.~taxonomic similarity, e.g., cue
``bird'' with match options ``lizard'' and ``toad.'' Additionally, we
included 10 attention check trials, which were formatted like the test
and filler triads but included an instruction instead of a cue item,
e.g., ``Choose wife'' with match options ``wife'' and ``husband.'' In
total, each participant completed 210 similarity judgments and 10
attention check questions, with triads presented in randomized orders
that varied between subjects.

\hypertarget{corpus-model}{%
\subsection{Corpus model}\label{corpus-model}}

To give an intuition for our model, consider again the cow-grass-chicken
triad: we retrieved word vectors for ``cow'' and ``grass'', and
calculate the cosine distance between these vectors. Similarly, we
retrieved vectors for ``cow'' and ``chicken'' and calculate the cosine
distance between them. Our similarity prediction is then inversely
proportional to the cosine distance of these pairs. This is because a
larger cosine distance means the word vectors are further apart, and
thus the words are less similar. For example, if the cosine distance of
thematic cow-grass is 0.7 and the cosine distance of taxonomic
cow-chicken is 0.3, then our model predicts, correspondingly, that 30\%
of responses to the triad will be grass, and the other 70\% chicken. We
then use a mixed-effects regression to evaluate how well each corpus
model predicts participants' similarity judgments, across triads and
languages.

\hypertarget{word-vector-retrieval}{%
\paragraph{Word vector retrieval}\label{word-vector-retrieval}}

We use the fastText pre-trained models of English, Mandarin, and
Vietnamese in Grave, Bojanowski, Gupta, Joulin, \& Mikolov (2018). These
models are trained on Common Crawl and Wikipedia using We distribute
pre-trained word vectors for 157 languages, trained on Common Crawl and
Wikipedia using fastText. These models were trained using a Continuous
Bag of Words (CBOW) with position-weights and a window of size 5. The
models use character n-grams of length 5 and 10 negative examples.From
the aforementioned models, we retrieve the word vectors (dimension 300)
for each word we are interested in.

\hypertarget{similarity-model}{%
\paragraph{Similarity model}\label{similarity-model}}

From the word vectors, we calculated the cosine distance between each
cue-thematic match (thematic cosine distance) and cue-taxonomic match
(taxonomic cosine distance), using the spatial.distance.cosine function
from the SciPy package (Virtanen et al., 2020). We then calculated the
thematic cosine distance proportion as thematic cosine distance over the
sum of taxonomic cosine distance and thematic cosine distance. We did
this for all three corpora. We were able to obtain predictions for all
triads in all languages.

taxonomic matching in the US and thematic matching in
Asia?}\label{do-we-extend-previous-work-reporting-a-preference-for-taxonomic-matching-in-the-us-and-thematic-matching-in-asia}}

The group means of proportion of thematic response in mainland China is
the highest (M = 0.65, SD = 0.12), followed by the groups means in
Vietnam (M = 0.6, SD = 0.13), which is slightly higher than that of the
US (M = 0.56, SD = 0.17) (Figure 1).

\begin{CodeChunk}

}

\caption[Proportion of thematic responses by country]{Proportion of thematic responses by country.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

To test for cross-context differences in similarity judgments between
the countries, we ran a mixed-effects logistic regression predicting
triad responding (taxonomic or thematic) with country (US, China, or
Vietnam) as a fixed effect. As random effects, we included an intercept
per subject and one per triad, as well as by-triad random slopes for
country to account for variation in the country effect across triads. In
R syntax, the model is: response \textasciitilde{} country + (1
\textbar{} subject) + (country \textbar{} triad).

Overall, there is a significant effect of country on proportion of
thematic responses (\(\chi^2\)(2) = 15.22, p \textless{} .001). However,
this effect is driven by the difference between US and China responding
(\(\beta\) = -0.53, p \textless{} .001). There is no statistical
difference between the Vietnam and China responding (\(\beta\) = -0.25,
p = 0.137), and the US and Vietnam responding (\(\beta\) = 0.28, p =
0.142).

On this analysis, we do not find support that the US-China tendencies
toward taxonomic and thematic responding (respectively) extend to the
US-Vietnam comparison. Accordingly, we cannot speak to overall biases
toward thematic responding across Asian cultural contexts broadly, but
we do replicate the differences documented by Ji et al. (2004) between
the US and China. However, in our corpus model comparison, we do find
evidence for different, more fine-grained variation in similarity
judgments between the US and Vietnam.

\subsubsection{Is responding in each cultural context predicted by

To test whether variation in lexical statistics can explain differences
in similarity judgments between US and Vietnam participants, we compare
logistic mixed-effects regression models fit to the thematic responding
data from each country separately. We first ask how well each corpus
model (English, Vietnamese, or Mandarin) predicts similarity judgments
by speakers of the corresponding language (US, Vietnam, or China). To do
this, we use a mixed-effects logistic regression to predict triad
responses (0=taxonomic or 1=thematic) with corpus prediction (proportion
of cosine distance) as a fixed effect and participant and triad as
random effects.

We found that all corpora are significant predictors of all cultural
context responding, with p\textless0.05 and \(\beta\) from -9.05 to
-2.44. (For a full report, see Appendix.)

two
corpora?}\label{is-responding-in-each-cultural-context-best-predicted-by-the-corresponding-corpuss-lexical-statistics-as-opposed-to-the-other-two-corpora}}

Next, we directly compare the corpus models by including both as fixed
effects in three mixed-effect regressions (predicting US, Vietnam and
China responding) with the same random effects as above. In R syntax,
the model is: response \textasciitilde{} corpus\_English +
corpus\_Vietnamese + corpus\_Mandarin + (1\textbar triad) +
(1\textbar subject).

For US responding: English (EN), Vietnamese (VI), and Mandarin (ZH)
corpus are all significant predictors. EN corpus: \(\beta\) = -7.14,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 16.78, p \textless{} .001. VI corpus: \(\beta\) = -2.28,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.74, p = 0.053. ZH corpus: \(\beta\) = -3.53,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.99, p = 0.046.

For Vietnam responding: English (EN), Vietnamese (VI), and Mandarin (ZH)
corpus are all significant predictors. EN corpus: \(\beta\) = -4.25,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.87, p = 0.049. VI corpus: \(\beta\) = -2.98,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 4.17, p = 0.041. ZH corpus: \(\beta\) = -4.86,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 4.94, p = 0.026.

For China responding: English (EN), Vietnamese (VI), and Mandarin (ZH)
corpus are all significant predictors. EN corpus: \(\beta\) = -3.52,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 7.85, p = 0.005. VI corpus: \(\beta\) = -1.62,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.57, p = 0.059. ZH corpus: \(\beta\) = -5.35,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 17.19, p \textless{} .001.

We observed some level of language specificity from this analysis. The
English corpus is the best predictor for US responding, and the Mandarin
corpus is the best predictor for China response. While this is not the
case with the Vietnamese corpus and the Vietnam responding, the
Vietnamese corpus is still a significant predictor for the Vietnam
responding (Figure 2).

\begin{CodeChunk}

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

However, we found that language specificity alone does not explain our
results. We used an ANOVA to compare the model with only the
corresponding corpus, and the model with all 3 corpora for each cultural
context. We found that in all three cases (US, China, Vietnam), adding
the other two corpora produces a significantly better fit than the
identical model without the additional corpora, and only the
corresponding corpus included as a predictor (US response: \(\chi^2\)(2)
= 8.42, p = 0.015; Vietnam response: \(\chi^2\)(2) = 15.21, p
\textless{} .001; China response: \(\chi^2\)(2) = 10.83, p NA).

\subsection{3. Does similarity reasoning differ across cultures, only
the input to it, or
both?}\label{does-similarity-reasoning-differ-across-cultures-only-the-input-to-it-or-both}}

Our analysis shows that lexical statistics of each corpus is a
significant predictor for similarity judgement in the corresponding
cultural context, even without the addition of the other two corpora.
Assuming that lexical statistics is a good proxy for environmental
statistics, we take the above result as evidence that cross-cultural
differences in input to the process of similarity judgement at least
partially drives cross-cultural similarity judgement differences.
However, it is still an open question whether the nature of similarity
judgement (for e.g., the notion of similarity) itself differs across
cultures and contributes to cross-cultural differences in similarity
judgement responding. In an alternative hypothesis, the cross-cultural
differences in similarity judgement observed is driven by not only the
input, but also an interaction between cultural-specific nature of
similarity judgement and input. To test this hypothesis, we
operationalize cultural-specific nature of similarity judgement as
country context, and input to similarity judgement as the corresponding
corpus statistics. We then compare a model that includes country,
corresponding corpus statistics and their interaction as fixed effects
(R syntax: responses \textasciitilde{} corresponding\_corpus * country +
(1\textbar triad) + (1\textbar subject)) to a model with only the
corresponding corpus statistics as the fixed effect (R syntax: responses
\textasciitilde{} corresponding\_corpus + (1\textbar triad) +
(1\textbar subject))

In the model containing only the corresponding corpus statistics, the
corpus statistics is a significant predictor (\(\beta\) = -1.75,
\(\chi^2\)(1) = 48.9, p \textless{} .001). When adding country and
interaction between country and corpus, both the corpus statistics
(\(\beta\) = -1.51, \(\chi^2\)(1) = 13.96, p \textless{} .001) and
interaction between country and corpus (\(\beta\) = NA, \(\chi^2\)(2) =
9.1, p = 0.011) are significant predictors. This suggests that there are
cross-cultural differences in both input and nature of similarity
judgement that drive differences in similarity judgement responding.

similarity judgments we observe? Are they limited to taxonomic-thematic

cases?}\label{how-general-are-the-cross-language-differences-in-similarity-judgments-we-observe-are-they-limited-to-taxonomic-thematic-contrasts-or-do-they-extend-to-other-cases}}

Previous work using the triad task such as Ji et al. (2004) has focused
on contrasting taxonomic-thematic match preferences, driven by a theory
of cross-cultural differences in notions of similarity. Meanwhile, our
approach has shown that notions of similarity only has an effect on
cross-cultural differences in similarity judgement when modulated by
input, and that input as proxied by lexical statistics of the
corresponding corpus by itself is a significant predictor for similarity
judgement responding. Our approach using lexical statistics do not
assume a taxonomic/thematic structure in the triads. Therefore, it
should be possible to predict similarity judgements to triads that do
not follow a taxonomic/thematic structure, such as our filler triads. If
our approach is tractable, we should be able to repeat the above
analyses to the filler triads, and find that lexical statistics of each
corpus is a significant predictor for similarity judgements in filler
triads of the corresponding cultural context.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

For each filler triad, we randomly assigned one of the responding
optiosn as `Word1'. Running a mixed-effects logistic regression predict
responding (Word1 or Word2) with structure equivalent to Analysis 1, we
found no effect of country on filler responding (Figure 3).

\subsubsection{Does lexical statistics for fillers predict responding in
the corresponding cultural
context?}\label{does-lexical-statistics-for-fillers-predict-responding-in-the-corresponding-cultural-context}}

Using the same mixed-effects logistic regression structure as Analysis
2, we predict responses (1=word1 or 0=word2) with corpus prediction
(proportion of cosine distance) as a fixed effect and participant and
triad as random effects. We found that in all cultural contexts, the
correpsonding corpora is a significant predictor of responding, with
p\textless0.05 and \(\beta\) from -9.59 to -3.05. (For a full report,

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In this paper, we consider whether statistics of the language
environment can account for cross-cultural differences in a classic
similarity judgment paradigm, as an alternative to the view that members
of different cultures vary in their conception of similarity.

We first tested the generality of a cultural account which holds that
people from Western and East Asian cultures tend to conceive of
similarity in more taxonomic and thematic ways, respectively, and
respond accordingly in categorization tasks such as ours. While we
managed to replicate the previously documented contrast between English
speakers in the US and Mandarin Chinese speakers from East Asia
(mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), we do not extend
this contrast to our sample of Vietnamese speakers in Vietnam and
English speakers in the US. This finding suggests some limitations on
the generality of this cultural account.

We did find some signatures of language specificity in our analysis,
such as the large positive correlation between similarity judgments of
each country and the respective corpus statistics, and how each corpus
statistics are good predictors for corresponding country's similarity
judgments. However, this is potentially due to the high correlation
between corpus statistics of English, Vietnamese and Mandarin. We find
even stronger evidence for consistency across the three groups, with
substantive overlapping predictions across the corpus models, highly
similar responding across the experiments, and a correspondingly high
fit in cross-language comparisons between models and data.

Our findings raise additional questions for future work: if not
differences in taxonomic vs.~thematic responding, then what differences
drive the relativity effects previous studies have observed? To what
extent are the relativity effects driven by language, and to what extent
by culture? Ji et al. (2004) established that culture-aligned
differences in this paradigm exist, even when the test language is held
constant, concluding that ``it is culture (independent of the testing
language) that led to different grouping styles'' in their study. Our
data provide a cautionary note to this conclusion, suggesting that
semantic representations in bilinguals (see Francis (2005) for a review)
may have the potential to provide an offline account for cross-context
differences in similarity judgments, independent of test language.
However, there are still many open questions for this account. How do
semantic associations guide categorization? Can they explain
taxonomic-thematic differences of the type reported by Ji et al. (2004)
and others? Can we provide a more specific computational account than
the simple frequency model tested here?

Despite these caveats, our findings here demonstrate the plausibility of
an alternative perspective on cross-cultural accounts of language,
thought, and similarity in the case of taxonomic and thematic reasoning:
that it may be the input to similarity judgments, rather than the
evaluative process or the conceptualization of similarity that produces
variation in similarity reasoning across cultural and linguistic
contexts. We hope this work provides a foundation for further research
probing this question.
